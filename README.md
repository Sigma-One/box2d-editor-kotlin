# Box2D Editor - DestSol Edition
### About
A rewrite of the old [Box2D Editor](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/box2d-editor), with this version intended for use with [Destination Sol](https://destinationsol.org).

This version is written in Kotlin from the ground up using the original as a reference.

Note however that despite being capable of actual use by now, it is still missing many features and is far from complete.

### Building and Testing
Use `gradlew run` to build and run the software, or use your IDEs facilities.

Use the left mouse button to add and the right one to remove points.
